# Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster ðŸš¢

This project is dedicated to the classic task of predicting the survival of passengers on the infamous Titanic. Here, I apply various machine learning algorithms to analyze real data, developing my skills in preprocessing, feature analysis, and modeling.

## ðŸ“Œ Project Goal
To create a model that predicts which passengers survived the Titanic disaster. This uses a dataset containing information about the passengers: age, gender, ticket class, number of relatives on board, and other characteristics that potentially influence survival chances.

## ðŸ“‚ Repository Contents
- **Data Analysis**: Exploration and visualization of features, identifying key factors associated with survival.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Data cleaning, handling missing values, encoding categories, and normalization to prepare for modeling.
- **Modeling**: Application of various machine learning algorithms â€” logistic regression, random forest, SVM, gradient boosting â€” and comparison of their performance.
- **Model Evaluation**: Selecting accuracy metrics and comparing model results to choose the best approach.

## ðŸ›  Technologies Used
- **Language**: Python
- **Libraries**: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn

## ðŸŽ¯ Results
My goal is to achieve high prediction accuracy, identify the main features influencing survival, and optimize the model for better outcomes.

## ðŸ“Š Data
The dataset is available on Kaggle: [Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic).
